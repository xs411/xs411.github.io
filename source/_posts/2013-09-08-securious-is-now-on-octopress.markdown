You may notice a drastic change in the look and feel of the site. We have recently migrated to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). 
Octopress is a blog-aware platform that generates static websites based on the 
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) language. This makes editing posts on any 
text editor very easy. A static website is a site that 
consists of only HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. The only dynamic aspects of this site are comments and 
search. However, search is performed by [Google](http://www.google.com) and comments are done in a separate iFrame by [Disqus](http://disqus.com/). This 
dramatically reduces the security footprint of the website - a welcome architecture feature 
for a security blog. 

More to come soon. Big thanks to [@coryfoo](http://twitter.com/coryfoo) for the recommendation to use [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).
